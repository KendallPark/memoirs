# Revision TODO

## The Narrator

- Narrator is a failed premed student instead of an English Major. There are a disproportionate number of writers for narrators in fiction. Most writers come from the humanities. I have a unique opportunity to show the world from the lens of a scientists.
- Need to establish a strong sense of what her family life was like, even though it will never be substantially explored. A more realized background will allow little bits and pieces can bleed through into the story.

## [Prologue](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/00Prologue.md)
- This chapter could perhaps be lengthened...
- More description is necessary of the father
- Perhaps introduce the translationary here


## [Chapter One: The Deathcolors of the Razni](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/01TheDeathColorsOfTheRazni.md)
- Should establish a greater connection between Timtok and the narrator.
- Should be less passive in this story.
- Summaries should turn to scenes

## [Chapter Two: Ecktuan Echoes](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/02EcktuanEchoes.md)
- More time on world, more time exploring the flora/fauna.
- Better description of the rooming situation
- More time with open ocean cousins, should get a stronger sense of danger
- What do domesticated animals look like? What about pets?
- CEPHALOPODS.
- Sunken city of old? Coral built over it? Plastic eating algae?
- Fire was the curse. Stole fire from the gods but could not handle it. Set world ablaze. "From the sea you arose, to the sea thou shalt return." A return to nakedness.
- Trapped on Ecktuo, cannot visit other planets because of their physiology.

## [Chapter Three: Umbron, World of Shadows](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/01TheDeathColorsOfTheRazni.md)
- The scene with the boy is too contrived. It needs to feel more natural for her to stumble upon underbelly of Umbron.
- The shadow blades are little bit cheesy and difficult to work out the physiology. Perhaps it acts more like an armor with bony outgrowths that can be trimmed or sharpened. Less vulnerable, more callused. Literally.
- More natural explanation of haploid and diploid physiology.
- Two competing reproductive systems, should pose the question of who is using whom?

## [Chapter Four: The Day and Night Seasons of Tenal Pici](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/04TheDayAndNightSeasonsOfTenalPici.md)
- Clearly a lot more needs to be added to the romance
- The relationship between the day and night cultures needs to be explored. As well as the biological basis.
- I need to think more on how their living spaces are constructed

## [Chapter Five: The Nomads of Rim](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/05TheNomadsOfRim.md)
- Do the math to figure out how feasible it is to walk around the world. The day is a little less than two earth years long.
- Figure out the length of the twilight regions
- Draft a better culture, think about countries, a lack of borders.
- Must trek through different environments... or not?
- Build up relationship with Merridan or whatever her name is.

## [Epilogue](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/blob/master/Chapters/06Epilogue.md)
- It's not really realistic that the mother was a Shadow.
- Perhaps the mother was some other, unknown alien.
- Perhaps the father is some other, unknown alien type.
