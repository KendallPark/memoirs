## Chapter Four: The Day and Night Seasons of Tenal Picii



I arrived on Tenal Pici with a pack full of steel on my back. Material trade between worlds is nearly impossible--you can only carry about your own body weight in goods. The planet was a adolescent one, probably around the same age as Earth. Most worldskippers avoid visiting worlds younger than their own, leaving the Fringe worlds nearly untouched by interworld travel. The youth of a planet indicates the relative flow of time in its universe. A traveler from an older world visiting a younger one could find himself thrust hundreds, even thousands of years into the future when returning to his own homeworld, his friends and family and previous life long deceased. Some companies have managed to make a profit along the Fringe,  mostly from rogue worldskippers wishing to shift off the beaten path. As a resident of the Fringe, I don’t have the same time-expansion issue that Inner World dwellers experience, so my days spent in another Fringe universe would roughly equate to same amount of days on my world.

The Frontiers Exploration Corporation offers hosting on several remote worlds--for a price to the traveler. I had considerable savings left over from my employment on Umbron (along with an extra enticement package they sent in hopes that I would keep my mouth shut), so I invested in a trip to Tenal Picii, informally known as the Polar Planet. Frontiers Exploration had an arrangement with a local Picii tribe, to exchange steel goods for half a year’s food and lodging in their frozen village. Not wanting to shift to the Fringe themselves, the Frontiers Exploration Corp loaded me with about a hundred pounds of steel goods to take as payment for my stay. They also provided me with state-of-the-art cold weather gear. 

The shiftport on Tenal Picii turned out to be less than ideal. The Picii managed to erect a structure of ice blocks over the area, while its barren, icy interior displayed how often the Picii expected offworld visitors. No one greeted me. I stepped through the single arched entryway of the building.

My eyes automatically squeezed shut as I stepped outside. I stared into the shadow I cast cast on the snow, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the light. The sun hung from the center of the sky, beaming over the dazzling white tundra. A gale streamed over the plains stirring up wisps of snow. My coat withstood the frigid wind, but I could feel my skin start to crack under thin gloves. It was summertime on Tenal Picii, and about the temperature of Chicago on the coldest day of the year.

Triangular shapes roamed over the snowy plains in the distance, like shark fins stalking through the tundra. One of them was heading my way. As it drew near, I noticed that the fin-like shape formed a sail, which connected to a boatlike hull. The hull itself rested on thin metal skates, and inside reclined a man with his hand on what appeared to be a tiller. The vessel skated along the ice at a tremendous speed. The man turned the ship into the wind and released the boom so that the sail fluttered aimlessly in the wind. After casting a heavy corded stone onto the ground--an anchor, I presumed--he stepped out. His outer coat sported patches of smooth gray fur, made from multiple animal hides sewn together. The boots featured a courser and darker type of animal skin, reaching just below his knees. The man’s face was obscured by his hood lined with long white fur, tucked behind a scarf and covering that looked like glasses with thin horizontal slits sliced out of each eye piece.

“Nigarro kinugu,” he said. I struggled to dig my translationary out of my coat pocket with gloved hands. An awkward ten seconds passed as I waited for it to boot up.

<Come again?> I asked. 

<Who are you?> he repeated. I couldn’t decide whether the tone was hostile or inquisitive. 

<I’m here for the Frontiers Exploration Corporation Extreme Polar Experience.>

The man grunted. <Well, then. Come with me.> And we walked to his vessel, an ice sailer, as I found out later. He loaded my bags in the hull, stopping momentarily to examine the contents of the steel-carrying bag. This seemed to cheer his moods a bit. I climbed into the hull with him. He gave me a fur blanket to cover my waist, hoisted up the anchor, and pushed the sail windward. The sail caught, veered the boat around, and we were off, racing across the tundra.

The the bladed runners rattled over the ice, absorbing the shock of the terrain. The hull bobbed pleasantly up and down. Though the wind conditions were not particularly strong, the vessel traveled significantly faster than the sailboats I had witnessed on Lake Michigan. I nestled lower underneath the furs so that only my squinting eyes poked out beyond its edges.       



From the exterior, the Piciian village appeared as small, snowy mounds budding from the white tundra. Three larger rectangular buildings composed of hewn ice blocks stood apart from the rounded domes. The Piciian man parked our vessel behind one of the taller ice buildings. 

He jumped out. I followed. I waited as he unfastened the sail, rolled it up, and stuffed it into a bag. The sack of metal I had brought with me he slung over his shoulder.

<Follow me,> he instructed.

I grabbed my small suitcase of effects and hurried after him. The mounds I had seen earlier were in fact igloos, but far larger than the ones I had seen in Earthen textbooks and documentaries about Alaska. They had an organic quality, many of them merging into their neighbors like soap bubbles. Fumes of smoke rose from stone chimneys extending from the mounds. 

The Piciian man led me to a narrow point extending out of the igloos. He held back a fur covering to reveal an icy tunnel, only a few feet in height. He hopped in, feet first, and disappeared from sight. I glanced around the village, squatted down, and crawled into the opening. The tunnel was smooth and sharply inclined that I slid naturally a few meters before emerging into the cavernous interior space. 

It was considerably warmer inside the igloo. Windows of translucent ice along the domed ceiling permitted a hazy light into the room while bright shafts of light poured through small holes in the ceiling. Fur coats hung from bone hooks protruding from the snowy walls. Boots of all sizes sat in pairs underneath the coats. Shelves had been carved into the walls behind the coats which appeared to house various other outdoor gear. A table made of packed snow stood in the center of the room. The innards of the bag clanked and the man placed them on the table. 

<Wait here,> said the man. He vanished down a hallway opposite the entrance. I stood around awkwardly, debating whether to take a seat on bench shaped from the snow. In all my previous travels, I had never felt as though I were intruding upon something. 

Voices echoes from the inner hallway. My translationary relayed the words as the chatting grew louder.

<She probably eats like a day-kin,> said a new voice, feminine in timbre.

<The day season is not yet over. We still have a eighth to hunt.>

<I don’t need to tell you how far the hunters are behind quota.>

The man from before walked back into the room followed by a middle-aged woman dressed in fine white furs. She was tall, taller than the man--around six feet, I would say. Her gray and black hair was woven into thin braids bound in a pony tail by a decorative bone barrette. Dark dry-cured skin creased around her mouth as she spoke. The man had removed his slitted goggles and met the woman with a stern black-eyed stare.

<I can hunt through the gray-season,> he said.

<Yes. You can. Fortune repays me for keeping a nobody around.> 

The man said nothing at this. The woman turned to address the stranger in the room. 

<Welcome to Tenal Picii,> she said. <I am the suruq-atan>--”Sun-Lady,” said my Pocket Translationary--<of this village. Please forgive the confusion. We do not receive any advance warning when a visitor shows up. When someone shifts into the port a beacon is lit from the building. That is the only way we know that a visitor has arrived.>



<It is fortunate that you arrived during the day. Frontiers Exploration doesn’t always schedule the shifts accordingly. We’ve had several ill-equipped travelers shift over during the night and freeze solid before we could reach them.> The Sun-Lady laughed as if she were retelling a pleasant joke. I rubbed my cold fingers together repetitively. 



<Is this from Frontiers Exploration Corporation?> 

<Yes.>

The Sun-Lady opened the pack of steel and pulled out a steel prong. It had a vicious barb on the end. She ran her gloved hand lightly over the metal piece then placed it back into the bag. 

<Get these in use right away. And don’t let Rorut touch them. He’ll be using a bone spear for a fifty more seasons. God knows how much metal he’s simply tossed into the sea.>





<Geruq, will you show her around the village while accommodations are prepped?>



[Narrator is introduced to the leader of the Piciian tribe, the Sun-Lady. The Sun-lady seems stressed by the visitor, though glad for the steel knives and harpoon heads that the narrator brings. It is hinted that the hunting this Day Season has been particularly poor. The tribe might not have enough food and provisions for the Night Season. The Sun-Lady assigned Geruq (the man she previously met) to take care of her.]



Tenal Picii is covered entirely by ocean save for two small continents both of the poles. The Picii inhabit these regions in small isolated communities. The rigors of living in sub-zero temperatures most of the year prevents the development of large civilizations. The ecosystem simply could not support a large population. 

Raging storms envelop the central portions of the planet, rendering it impossible to traverse from one pole the next. Until the rise of transworld shifting, Piciians had no contact with their cousins on the opposite end of the world. Piciians from both poles hold myths about the other. The most commonly expressed lore consists of a mirror-reality where each person has an alter-ego living on the other side. When the gods drew the Picii from the void, they divided nothingness into a Day and Night counterpart, and placed them on opposite ends of the world. If a Piciian ever made contact with his alterego, they would merge, back into the nothingness from which they were drawn. To prevent this the gods erected two barriers of water, the sea and storms.

In contemporary times, several Picii have traveled to the other side of their world, via extra-dimensional pathways. The cultures are not remarkably different, I’m told, despite having lived apart for thousands of years. Some anthroxenologists hypothesize that shared characteristics of their lives--the extreme cold, dependency on hunting, and so on--prompted convergent cultural phenomenon. The Picii on both poles are pragmatic, animistic, and extremely communal. 

I ended up staying on the Left Pole. Delineations such as “north” and “south” have no applicability to the Picii, as each pole considers itself the northern, upright pole. “Left” refers to the direction the sun rotates around the sky from the perspective of one standing on the surface.

Aside from the yearlong freezing temperatures, the situation of the Picii on the planet poles adds a particularly distinguishing aspect of life to inhabitants: half-year “days” and half-year “nights.” The sun does not rise and set, but rather circles the sky, slowing spiraling to the center of the sky at the beginning of the Day Season, and then spiraling back down to the horizon during the latter half the Day Season, before setting below the horizon to commence the Night Season.



[The narrator finds more out about the Tenal Picii world and culture, including it’s 24 hour days and 24 hour nights, and the social divide between those born in the night, and those born in the day. The Day-kin are usually larger, stronger, and spend the Day Season hunting and building. The Night-kin are smaller, have a greater endurance, and perform most of the house duties. During the Night Season, the Night-kin are responsible for the upkeep of the village, while the Day-kin are confined inside. This is done because the Day-kin have a higher metabolism.



Meanwhile, Geruq is following her around. At first she thinks that this is to keep her out of trouble, but then the narrator thinks that he’s expressing some form of curiosity. The narrator learns that Geruq was born in the period of twilight between the Day and Night Seasons, making him neither Day-kin or Night-kin. This makes him a sort of outcast as well as a loner, as one may only marry into the opposite kin-group, for the sake of “balance.” Geruq teaches her how to cross country ski and invites her to travel with him to check the fishing lines on the coast. The pair develop a good rapport, and still manage to communicate well when the narrator’s translationary goes missing a few days before the trip to the ocean.]



Geruq and I set out early in the morning, but without the sunrise, it’ll suffice to say that we left earlier than I would have liked. I’ve always had issues escaping my warm covers in the wintertime, can you imagine the difficulty crawling out of a bed of fur blankets into a room made of ice? Even during the Day Season, where the sun shines perpetually, a trip outdoors requires three layers of clothing. 

I had long since packed away the clothes I had brought with me. Even the cold gear given to me by Frontiers Exploration lacked the durability of a barag-fur coat. My first layer consisted of thin quinals-down, both shirt and stockings. I put these on, fur-side in, touching my skin. Over the underwear, I put on my sealskin undercoat and trousers. Again, these were designed so that the fur side faced inward. Another layer of socks, of the thicker sealskin were added over my feet. The outercoat and pants were made of the thickly furred barag-hide. 

The pants covered the sealskin trousers and attached to the bottom of the undercoat. I pulled my tall boots of dual-layered sealskin over the pants, and strapped them to my legs with cords of hide. Jagged sharkskin lined the bottom of the soles. 

Finally, I donned the barag parka. I had seen a barag before, the corpse of one at least, transported back to the village on a sled by a two skiers. It looked like bear-sized wolverine, a predator of the sea mammals, with black snarled claws for digging through ice. The long, white hairs on my coat faced outward, and were stained with various patterns, including a school of fish swimming around the midsection. The parka’s hood and sleeves were trimmed with the bushy barag tail. While my hands remained uncovered, I fastened a thin leather handkerchief around over my mouth and nose, and a pair of snow goggles--the only useful piece of equipment from Frontiers Exploration--around over my eyes. I squeezed my hands into a pair of quinals-down covered gloves, then secured sealskin mittens over them. 

Geruq was waiting for me outdoors, holding two sets of whalebone skis over his shoulder. He handed me the bindings, which I fastened around my boots, then helped me set into the skis. For poles we each carried two harpoons of bone, tipped with a one-edged steel barb. The Picii do not have access to iron, save for the meteorites that occasionally fall on the plains. Even then, they can only chip away metal bits from the meteorites and fix them into bone or stone blades, as they lack the heat necessary for forging. The cast steel harpoon barbs had come from Frontiers Exploration, brought as payment for my stay, or perhaps by travelers before me.

Geruq strapped the sled harness to his torso and then we set off for the ocean. By this time I had gotten the hang of skis, how to shift my weight from one leg to the next as I plowed forward with poles. Ten minutes into the activity, we shed our outer coats and placed them in the sled. The fishing grounds were about three hours out from the village.

On our way we passed through the ruins of another village. The ice buildings had been reclaimed by the elements, and only piles of rock marked where the chimneys had stood. Geruq stopped and pulled a small square of meat from the sled. Kneeling in front of a stone mount, he placed the meat at its base, closed his eyes, and drew two circles in the air with his arms. As I moved closer, my ski struck something. 

I looked down. The bones of an arm protruded from the ice, flesh gnawed off by tundra scavengers. The frayed bits of a coat formed around the place where the two bones plunged into the ice. The ice was clear enough to make out a shadowed figure, encased by the elements. I shivered and looked away, hurrying toward Geruq. I wished desperately for my translationary. What I guessed from Geruq’s hand signals, was that a blizzard had struck the village during the Night Season. I later learned that it wasn’t the blizzard itself that doomed the village, but the fact that it tore apart their food store, which they had foolishly built above the ground. No one knew whether they starved to death or died of hypothermia due to the lack of blubber to burn. The ice swallowed the bodies, keeping them perfectly preserved in its depths. Parts of ice would periodically melt away, exposing a corpse to the mercy of the elements and animals. 

By the time we reached the fishing grounds, the sun had swung around behind us. I could see the ocean beyond the ice shelf, calmer than I expected. A dark line of clouds marked the horizon, though they never seemed to drift parallel to us, never any closer. 

Geruq showed me the holes carved out of the thick ice, each with a fishing cord strung though it. The ends of the cords were tied around large boulders, which I presumed had been hauled out to the ice shelf for this purpose. Geruq went about checking the lines for catches, replacing the bait with fresh meat. I was left with the task of widening the ice holes, as they threatened to close over a period of time. I stabbed at the ice perimeter with a bone harpoon, chipping chunks off into the sea below.

“Piquira!” yelled Geruq. This was my village nickname, which meant “snow face” in Piciian. I trotted to the ice hole he stood over. He yanked on the fish line, slowly drawing it from the water. I dropped my harpoon and helped him tug the line up. Whatever had been caught must have been massive. The line stopped moving. Geruq and I ran up to the ice hole to look at the creature we had snagged. From our view point we could make out jaws of a deep water shark. Having some experience with sea creatures, I would estimate the shark to stretch about seven meters in length. A huge caught, which would go a long way to supply food for the Picii during the Night Season. I knew Geruq was hoping to snag a sort of sea mammal for their blubber, whose oil they used for fires, but a catch this large still meant a great accomplishment. And there was no way that it would fit through the current hole in ice, which was only half a meter in diameter. 

He ran off and returned with two harpoons, tossing me one. I looped the extra harpoon cord around my arms as a precaution and plunged the barb into the ice. We worked for an hour, slowly widening the hole so we could haul our catch from the sea.

Then we felt a tremor in the ice underneath us. High pitched noises vibrated through the shelf. Then a long, sustained moan. Water splashed from the hole and shark’s body disappeared under the surface. The fishing line was being pulled through the hole. I started in the direction of the line in order to grab hold as more and more of it was dragged into the depths. Geruq held me back. The line snapped taught against between the ice hole and the boulder to which it was fastened. Unable to move the boulder, the pressure on the rim of the fishing hole started a fissure, which snaked behind us in semicircle. The patch on which we stood groaned, threatening to separate from the rest of the ice shelf. Geruq drew a knife from his coat, and severed the cord. We watched it vanish into the ocean.

A massive red creature burst through the ocean’s surface at the edge of the shelf. The head of a whale, bigger than any creature I had ever seen, save the shadowed figure on Ecktuo. It’s skin sported an orange-red color, and clutched in its white spire teeth was a large fish, our shark. It whipped the shark around by the tail and then tossed it towards us. Geruq pushed me out of the way as the dead shark sailed overhead, skidding to a stop on the ice behind us. The whale plunged under the water again. Moments later I felt a bump. A terrifying crackling noise erupted from the fissure. We were free from the shelf, drifting away.



[The whale continues to “play” with the narrator and Geruq. Geruq is holding onto the snapped fishing line that is fortuitously anchored to the rest of the ice shelf, trying to keep their small iceberg from drifting into the sea. The whale starts to prod at their iceberg, tipping them this way and that. Whenever either person nears the edge of the berg, the whale keeps them at bay, blowing water and air at them.]



I leapt off the iceberg onto the back of the red beast, plunging the spear into the spouting hole. It sank deep into the airway. The entire spear nearly consumed by flesh. The red creature on which I crouched started, with a rumbling groan, what I took to be gagging. I held unto the spear line as the whale dove and surfaced in great thrashes, spewing water and blood from its blowhole. The water hit my face like razor tears, fusing with the skin, then snagging small bits of skin off as the ice fragments where flung off. The beast continued to thrash about, but I wound the spear line tight around my right arm, whose bones threatened to snap. I could smell the friction-burned seal pelt of my outer coat. But I held, and the beast’s throws began to wane.

In a final leap, I was tossed off the beast’s back. I hung there by the spear line, in the water, pressed against the whale’s head, with no strength to hoist myself out of the water. I could see his eye, clearly, which for the whale’s enormity, was not much bigger than my own. It displayed the recognition, the eye contact of two intelligent, frightened creatures. I stared a him for a moment, still insulated by my coating layers. The ice water began to leak in, first as frozen rings around my calves and wrists and neckline, then flowing through the folds of animal skins to my inner linings. Water rolled down my spine. I gasped. The whale grinned, ivory teeth bared in confusion, wondering how his game had ended this way. And dying, he rolled on his back, hauling me onto his orange-red belly, as I was still attached to the blowhole by spear line.

I lay flat against the red blubber of the dead creature, my soaked garments and skin and hair crystallizing in the wind. Too exhausted to shiver or curl up. I felt a tug on the spear line around my arm, but faintly, through a haze. The ice shelf grew closer. Geruq was over me, gathering numb limbs, then I over him, his shoulder. He tucked my hands into his scarf, blowing hot breaths through my fingers. 

I felt the warm buzz in the back of my head, the warm waters of sleep rising. But Geruq held me, singing over and over in rhythm with his ski strides: “Stay with me, remain here with me, night and day, night and day."



I woke cold but burning, my bare, sticky flesh firmly sandwiched between the skin of two men that lay on either side of me. I struggled to move, then gave up. I lacked the energy to even feel embarrassed by the situation. Piciian words traveled over my head from one shirtless man to the other. They pulled the fur blankets tighter around our trio. From my vantage point I could see the hearty orange blaze of a hearth fire reflecting off the sweating ice walls. I drifted back to sleep.

I recall half-waking several times after that, slipped in and out of dreams as I felt figures move around me, shifting covers and weights. Different voices chatted around me. When I finally came to, I was alone. 

I found myself underneath a mass of fur and hides facing a large stone heart. A healthy fire danced from a large oil lamp, filling the room with the musky scent of burning blubber. Ice walls extended from the stone hearth in a circular fashion around the sleeping shelf on which my bed rested. Figures and runes were cut out of the ice, winding around the carved-out cubbies which stored various items. A single doorway stood left of the fireplace with a [animal] skin hung over the opening. 

Slowly, I sat up. The ice room swayed, my head pulsed. 

<Careful,> chimed a familiar voice. I turned around. Too fast. I clutched my head, dizzy. Geruq sat on another section of shelf behind me, holding out an object in his hands for me to take. <Here,> relayed the translationary as it passed hands. The tips of my fingers ached slightly as I held the device. A few blisters showed on them, fingerpads red and sensitive. 

<Eight sun-circles have passed since I brought you back to the village,> said Geruq. <The coldsleep almost took you, but we warmed you in time. There were at least two people with you for the first circle.> I recalled the circumstances of my previous awakenings. 

<Did you…?> I indicated at the bed around me.

<No.> Geruq’s dark eyes looked down in what seemed like embarrassment. <Custom dictates that only the Sunkin may restore heat to another individual.>

<I suppose that makes sense,> I said absently. A piece of grit had become caught in my toes, and wiggled them about under the covers, trying to free it. The flesh of my feet revolted against this movement, replying with dull rounds of pain. 

<Where am I?> I asked.

<You are in the [Chief] and [Lady]’s sleeping den. They insisted that you recover here after they learned you had slain the [red whale]. The harpoon held fast in its carcass. We dragged it back to town.>

<Will it make for night-provisions?>

<Yes! More than enough. We’ll have plenty of meat to eat until spring, whale oil to keep us warm.>

<May I see it?> I was curious to see the beast in its entirety, entirely hauled out of the water.

<Not yet,> said Geruq. My friend stood and moved to the fireplace where an iron pot was suspended over the flames. From pot he drew steaming water with a ladle and poured it into a nearby skullcap basin. He quickly dipped his fingers in and out of the hot water, paused for a moment of thought, then found several fragments of ice and added them to the basin. He brought the warm water to the foot of the sleeping shelf. 

<I need your feet,> he said. With a small amount of effort, I slid my legs over the edge of the sleeping shelf. Socks of soft [fuzzy animal] hide covered my feet. Geruq took the right foot in his hands and carefully removed the hide. 

I inhaled, a sharp intake of air. The tips of my toes were black, as if they had been dipped in ink. A clear boundary existed between the charcoal-black of the toe tips and the pink, peeling flesh on the remainder of the foot.

<We might yet save them,> said Geruq and he undressed my other foot. It had the same condition, though only two of the toes showed severe frostbite. He slid the bone water basin under my feet and slowly lowered them into the water. The body of my feet screamed as though flames had engulfed them. But the pain cut off suddenly at my black, petrified toes. I reached down and touched one of my blackened big toes. It felt as though it were another object entirely, shriveled and hard. Geruq stirred the water gently, generating a swirling current of warm water. 

I laughed unexpectedly. My toes were Shadow-wannabes. 



In the following month I lost most of my right big toe and the tips of several others. The black digits simply fell off, like charcoal scabs. Some of the blackened skin revived on my left foot, sparing all but the tip of my second toe from decay. 

After the soles of my feet had healed sufficiently, my Nightkin caretakers allowed me to walk about the [Cheif] and [Lady]’s room, then through the ice tunnels back to my own. The walking was awkward at first, but to the Darwin’s credit, I swiftly adapted to the new shape of my right foot. Geruq slept on the icy floor beneath my bed shelf, as I was not to be left alone at any time. During the working hours a Nightkin came by to exchange shifts so that Geruq could assist the village in preparing for the winter. The time in between working and sleeping hours I read to him from the Renton Anthology of Colored Works. The Pocket Translationary labored to convey the Razni words with the correct stresses and diphthongs of Piciian dilect. At first he would listen from the opposite end of the sleeping shelf, but the cold worked us closer together each day, so that I found myself propped against his chest with his arm around my waist and chin resting on my shoulder as I read. 

The Nightkin physician finally declared me fit to go outdoors. Geruq helped me put on the necessary layers and layers of clothes and escorted me from the tunnels into the open air. The sun had sunk low in the sky during my time indoors, casting a perpetual rose sunset as it circled the horizon, its edge just scraping the corners of the planet. The icy terrain formed a two-toned landscape, from the pink sunlit surfaces to the blue shadows. 

Geruq led me to the butcher grounds where the [red whale] had been cut up. Some of the blubber would be processed for oil, the rest stored with the meat in the pantries as food and fuel, explained Geruq. Specialty parts such as the bladder sac (used as sailcloth) were given to the appropriate Nightkin craftsmen.

Bundled children ran through the ribs of the [red whale], now stripped bare. Swathes of red hide took their turn stretched out and scraped clean against the rib spars. The Picii saved the  softer cuts of skin around the fins and jaws for consumption. I approached the head of the beast. Its mouth gaped open, forever fixed in that amused grin, though I noticed most of its white teeth had been removed. The skin had shriveled around the skull, eyes sunk deep into the sockets. The harpoon had been removed from the blowhole, no doubt to salvage the iron head. I placed my gloved hand on the beast’s leathery snout. 



A feast was held on Sunset Day, before the last edges of the orange sun plunged below the horizon. The whole tribe sat around a open pit of blubber with the massive [red whale] roasted above it. The Sunlady offered me a seat aside her and the Nightchief. Choice pieces from the [red whale] were placed in front of me: liver, intestine, brain. Before anyone ate, the Nightchief cut a slice of the heart meat and presented it to me. I bit into the tough muscle, chewed, and swallowed. Drums of bone and [seal] hide rung out and the Nightkin musician chanted. The celebration commenced. After eating our fill, we linked up in concentric chains, dancing around the oil flames, watching the last silvers of sunlight fade into a green aura. 

Dusk lasted around two weeks. The village seemed to glow blue in the twilight, and the Sunkin hurried to move all needed provisions into the storage buildings. During the Night Season, the Picii would remain inside the network of buildings and tunnels submerged in the ice. Only the  Nightkin would be allowed outdoors to clear out air shafts and track the stars. 

Geruq, as child of the twilight, did not have to adhere the social rules of the Sunkin and Nightkin. A small reward for his isolation, I suppose. When the Night Season had fully fallen, Geruq prompted me to dress for the outside, asking me to add yet another layer to the layers, for good measure. It was not yet so dangerously cold to prevent me from leaving the interior rooms. I wrapped my face in the soft down of the [someanimal] and followed Geruq out the main entryway. 

The cold hit immediately as soon as we left peeled open the outer air seal. It was dry, and biting, unlike the wet cold of the Day Season. It clung to the inside of my lungs and my eyes blinked away tears which fell as ice crystals into the snow. The patches of ice on which we walked had ceased to be slippery, but stuck to the underside of our boots. Geruq nudged me and reminded me to look upwards.

My God, I have never seen so many stars. Like pinpricks of light pouring through a tattered black blanket. Ribbons of green light oscillated over the starry canvas, rolling over the sky from edge to edge. The streams of light flooded and dissipated, winding around each other in igniting the night with greens and blues. 

In all the worlds, I have never seen a more beautiful sight. I stood there, shivering in Geruq’s arms for nearly an hour, watching the polar lights, until my shivering intensified to the point of convulsions. Geruq insisted that we go back inside. 

After warming in the Great Room, Geruq lead me down several lamp lit corridors into his own dwelling place. It was simple hold, adorned only by several exotic furs pinned into the ice walls. An antique harpoon with a bone barb rested on the wall over the sleeping shelf. My friend reached into one of the nooks in his wall and pulled out a bundle of soft leather. He unfolded the leather cloth and held out an ivory amulet, intricately carved from a single tooth. 

“Piquira,” he said with a strange intonation, “I would like to stay with me.” 

I stepped back. 

Geruq continued, “I have never and will never meet another like you. I believe the gods have drawn us together, two outsiders, and ordained our union. If you remain here with me, as my wife, I promise to love you and care for you all the seasons of Night and Day.”

I said nothing. His composed words exhausted, he added in Piciian, <I know a hunter on the coldest world of the worlds has little to offer a woman such as yourself. But I can give you all of myself, and perhaps that is enough. Please, consider.>

I looked into the face of the dark-skinned man, his long black hair falling over his equally black eyes. I looked at the betrothal necklace, so delicately carved. Then I uttered one of the only Piciian words I knew.

“Naga.”

No.
