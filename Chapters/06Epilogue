“You’re almost as old as me now,” he said, looking me up and down. Somewhat an exaggeration, but partly true. It was only two years since my departure from Earth, but there had been what, a decade, two decades spent on alien worlds? Who knew how the years translated. 

“What now?” he asked.

“Find a job, I guess.”

“Oh, the answer your question…” My father unbuttoned his plaid shirt. Black, void-black. 

“And you loved her?”

“Always.”



The final parts of my life are not worth telling. I have only given you the first part, the part of least importance to me. The rest I will keep to myself, having finally known the secret and burden and joy of the humanities.

But to summarize: I got a job as an accountant. I married. Bore four children. One died of leukemia at age seven. The others grew up, went to college, and now live as a store manager, research biologist, and doctoral student in oriental history. I haven’t left our world since returning from Rim. In fact, I haven’t left this town. Life grows toward its natural end.
