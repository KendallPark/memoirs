## Chapter Two: Ecktuan Echoes

Ecktuo is an old world. The ancestors of the Ecktu had terrestrial bodies like ours, but evolved to embrace the rising sea that spread over the continents ages ago. Thousands of years in the water smoothed over their bodies, sanding off the rough angles. What remained was a streamlined build, able to slip through the water with sleek, rubbery skin. Time stretched their hands into fins, webbing enclosed the space between their fingers. Feet flattened into flippers.

The faces of the Ecktu are rounder than ours, with bare slits for noses and ears. Long tendrils hang from their heads where you and I would have hair. They are a beautiful, graceful people. Part of me wonders if some worldshifting Ecktu lurk in the waters of Earth, perpetuating sailors’ tales of mermaids and mermen.

The Ecktu possess two forms of communication. The first consists of high pitched patterned clicks emitted from the forehead. Speaksee, they call it, as it also carries the function of echolocation. My translationary, with its new aquatic adapter, had no trouble in deciphering this. The second mode, songspeak, is far more obfuscated. Some might call the low, undulating wails a form of music, but they apparently carry a complex semantic meaning that alludes the Pocket Translationary, causing it to sputter out nonsense words. The Ecktu claim to fully understand songspeak, but ask one to translate songspeak into speaksee, and he’ll look at you as if you were asking him to swim through the air. 

Outfitting for Ecktuo was an exhausting process. Not many people visit Ecktuo other than wealthy diving enthusiasts. There’s a whole rigmarole of training and licensing required to use Camirean diving gear. The SCUBA certification I had obtained as a teenager was a cakewalk in comparison. Thank goodness the Kiku Academy was willing to pay. Offering interworld studies programs seems to be the up and coming academic trend on Ecktuo. Kiku Academy, not wanting to be left behind, had recently started to recruit offworlders to stay on Ecktuo for a term. I suspect that my past diving experience gave me an edge over the other applicants. All I had to do was show up as a panelist during interworld studies lectures and, of course, let myself be paraded around social events as the school’s token terrestrial. 

The Kiku Academy is located in one of the larger cities along the Equatorial Reef. To understand marine cities, you must imagine a world without fire, without combustion. Underwater, one has very little ability to mold lifeless matter into useful things. Clays cannot be fired, metal cannot be smithed, glass cannot be blown. A house of stone may be erected on the seabed, but with the shifting sands and tide, it will eventually come apart. In the sea, buildings must be grown.

There are specific corals on Ecktuo singled out for the purpose of construction. Some, like rushrock, are selected for their growth speed. Others, such as beam coral are specialized in strength. There are many corals used for purely aesthetic purposes. The slowly maturing crystalzoan is coveted for the way it reflects light off its crystalline skeleton, like the refraction of diamonds. All together, the process of growing a building takes a fair chunk of time and commitment. Coral must be fed, mated, protected from predators, and shaped as it expands, inch by inch. 

I can’t imagine how long it took to build the underwater studio where I resided. I suspect Kiku retrofitted an older coral structure, waterproofed and sealed, then filled it with air. I appreciated the amount of effort they put into making it as dry as possible, but I don’t know much could be helped in the end. My land-clothes and bedsheets stayed in a perpetual state of semi-dampness. And though workers changed out the air daily, (and planted several more carbon dioxide scrubbers) the stale flavor of yesterday’s breath never lifted. 

Air. That’s another thing. The Ecktu breath air like us, an homage to their land-walking ancestors. And while they can hold their breath for nearly an hour, they must inevitability return to the ocean’s surface to exchange a lungful of air. Because of this, the early sea-dwelling Ecktu formed nomadic societies, tethered to the surface by their unrelenting need for the atmosphere’s oxygen. This dependence lasted until the domestication of an algae known as air kelp. 

The Ecktu cultivate air kelp in the rocky tidal regions of their seas. From holdfast to stipe-tip the kelp can measure over a hundred meters in height. Golden blades extend outward from the stipe like branches. Large air bladders suspended on a thin, tubular tissue, much like balloons on a string, hoist the kelp blades upwards. The Ecktu call these pockets of air, air fruit, as they contain a rich mixture of breathable air. Kelp farmers harvest the air fruit, which are self-contained and easy to transport. One air fruit holds about half a day’s worth of air for the average Ecktu. (My inefficient lungs, however, require about twenty of these fruits per day, something which caused me a good deal of embarrassment.)

The readily available source of oxygen allowed for expansive urban development at moderate depths of the shelf. Cities of coral rose out of the Ecktuan reefs, and settlers moved into the underwater caverns along the edge of the shelf. During the night, these the cities light up with an array of colorful, luminescent creatures. The coral walls of my room, emitted a faint yellow light. Not enough to read by, but sufficient to find my way to bed each night. 


Ahoy, Bubbles! my translationary chimed. I turned under my damp sheets and rubbed my eyes. Always these strange dreams. I shook my head in attempt to exorcise my grogginess. Two familiar Ecktuan heads bobbed out of the floor port of my room. The Academy had given me a roommate of sorts. Niko, a young Ecktu female. We didn’t actually share a room, as Ecktu sleep underwater. She lived next door, and was assigned the task of helping me into my diving gear every morning (which, believe me, was quite the endeavor). She was perhaps a few years younger than me, I could never tell how Earthen years scaled against those of Ecktuo.

Bubbles, are you awake? Niko clicked, treading water in the port. “Bubbles” was a literal translation of my nickname from the Academy, a reference to the stream of bubbles that spew out of my mask every exhalation. So wasteful! they no doubt clicked amongst themselves, but ultimately excused the behavior as a cultural difference. I greeted the pair with the exemplary grumpiness of a woken terrestrial. I had nothing planned for this morning outside of the perimeter of my soggy bed. The other Ecktu face in my room was Nonoke, her beau, whom she toted around for even the most menial of tasks, like waking up roommates in the early morning. I looked out the round port window. A few bioluminescent coral still glowed in the gray waters. By God, it was early! I had once tried to explain that young Earthens should never be disturbed before midday on weekends. Niko didn’t buy this. Evidently.

The Kiku Academy officially invites you! she said, blinking her ruddy eyes rapidly in the air of my room. To join a delivery of medical supplies. To a clan of open ocean nomads. Tomorrow! Will you accept?

I gave them my agreement. They dove back down, through the floor port, singing to each other as they swam off.


I had never left the shelf before. Niko joined me as I watched a group of Ecktu load up the supply float. They harnessed the float to a team of sea mules, thick, blubbery creatures that reminded me of Earthen manatees. The Ecktu escort rode alongside the team atop bucksharks, a breed well-suited for the long voyage. Bucksharks look entirely menacing, especially when they swim at you head-on, their massive jaws gaping open. 

Filter feeders, Niko assured as she placed her handfin inside the mouth of Yawn, her family’s two year-old pup. Reflexively, he clamped down on her arm. I clenched my eyes, but Niko did not cry out in pain as I expected, easily forcing the shark’s toothless jaws back open to retrieve her arm. She scratched his sandpaper belly then instructed me on how to correctly mount a shark. It’s not the way you would imagine, sitting upright. We rode flat on his back, on either side of the dorsal fin, held by a loop of hide attached to a harness around Yawn’s midsection. 

Niko handed me the reins, a set of four cords which were threaded through upper and lower sections of Yawn’s gills on both sides. Left and right, up and down. A shark cannot stop swimming, my roommate explained. We circled the supply convoy with the other buckshark riders as we waited for the last of the medical goods to be loaded. Antibiotics, antiparisitics, cultivated by the academy in the rich reef flora. I guided Yawn’s gawking mouth to pockets of plankton, which he happily fanned through his gills. Then we departed, due east, away from the reef. 

I cannot describe the uncanny feeling, leaving the shelf. Peering out below, I watched the flat seabed suddenly drop into a steep slope, plunging into the dark blue. We had crossed into the open ocean, an eternal gradient of blues and greens. Limitless sea in every direction, save upwards, where beams of light danced through the watery ceiling. The ocean floor lay far beyond the light’s reach.


We traveled close to the surface of the ocean, not wishing to waste air supplies. Niko took the reins, and guided Yawn up to the ocean ceiling. For the first time since my arrival, I breached the surface of the ocean. My diving mask immediately fogged in the warm air. Floating with my head above the waves, I lifted the mask off my face and looked at the sky. It was white-gray. A milky haze with no discernible shapes of clouds or cracks of blue, anywhere. A thick blanket of cloud surrounds the entire planet, I am told, rendering the heavens perpetually overcast. There is no sun. There are no stars. Only gray.

Perhaps this is why the Ecktu are so disinterested in what lies above the surface of the sea. On Earth, it seems, we spent our history looking up to the heavens. We scaled the highest points of the planet, and when that wasn’t enough, we learned to fly like the birds. And after we could soar higher than the tallest mountains, we broke free of the atmosphere itself and pressed into the vacuum beyond.
 
To put it in perspective, more people have walked on our moon than dived below 240 meters in Earth’s oceans. Recreational divers like myself rarely descend past 30 meters. My offworld Camirean gear allows me to reach depths of 100 meters safely. (Diving below which apparently voids the warranty.) But even halfway to that distance, one can feel the warm lull of narcosis, “the rapture of the deep.” Intoxication by air itself. Water pressure compounds at every meter. It constricts around your skin, crushing the air in your lungs, pushing it into your blood. The marine biology of the Ecktu allows them to dive 300 meters down without consequence, their bloodstreams capable of filtering out the pressure-dissolved air. By 200 meters it is too dark for photosynthetic life. Absolute darkness hits before 1000 meters, still less than a mile’s travel downward. 

For the Ecktu, the great mystery lies below. The depths of the world’s ancient oceans remain their constant subject of exploration. There is a hole in the Southern Sea, a hundred miles in diameter, where sound disappears--an uncanny experience for the Ecktu, who can detect the reflection of speaksee clicks off surfaces tens of miles away. My translationary renders the speaksee name for this region as “Heaven’s Gap.” Strange ice has been spotted on occasion, floating up from its depths.

While at a rest stop, I nearly lost my Pocket Translationary. Yawn’s tail fin brushed by, knocking it loose from my diving pack. I didn’t notice until it had sunk ten meters already, slipping through darker veils of blue beneath my feet. Rendered utterly mute, there was nothing I could do but dive after it myself. I kicked my fins hard, trying to close the distance. My ears ached from the quick descent. The device was falling faster than I could swim. Fortunately, Niko saw me, and located the sinking device with a burst of clicks. She dove after it, swiftly passing me up with her graceful stroke. She returned, gripping the device with her handfin. The translationary spat out my thank you.

If only I could describe the vastness through which we traveled. In the open ocean there are no assurances, no coral structures or ocean floor limiting the expanse.    Well outside the boundaries of the luminescent city, night engulfs the ocean in a pitch black limbo. The supply convoy carried traps of glowing krill, which shed a pale, green light that lit the edges of our pod. I wondered if these were brought only for my sake. The Ecktu have no issue moving through the darkness, using their clicksee to scout out the miles ahead. During the night periods I clung to Yawn’s course shark skin as I slept. Sleeping underwater is strangely easy, like floating adrift in a distant memory. I dreamed of music again, the long, drawn out notes calling louder in the open sea.

The second day out I spotted a shadow in the deep blue, growing wider and darker in color. The creature was still far below us, yet its shadow spread out beyond the perimeter of the caravan. Details of the silhouette came into focus. I craned my head backwards and watched the blur of what I imagined was an enormous tail, fanning the water methodically. The shadow eventually sank back into the depths from which it arose, swallowed by the deep blue. It wasn’t until then that I noticed the barbed whale-tooth harpoons the riders carried, strapped to the backs of the bucksharks.


After five days of travel, we met up with the nomads. They lived in a pod of about thirty members. Niko introduced me to one of the younger nomads, Lukun, before joining the crowd of Ecktu unloading supplies from the float. I had never seen a nomadic Ecktu. One can easily tell the difference between the nomads and the reef-dwellers. Their bodies are leaner, cut with thicker cords of muscle, and their skin carries a purer blue than the common turquoise. They swim faster and can hold their breath nearly twice as long as the average Ecktu. This is out of necessity, as they don’t have the luxury of air fruit, and must return to the surface for every breath. It’s an older way of life, tribal, and free.

Lukun was perhaps more curious about me than I was him. I removed my diving fins to show off my pink, wrinkled feet. He asked to see my hands as well, my short, web-less fingers. How much like a helpless child I looked, thrashing around in the ocean with these stubs of appendages. Finally, I removed my mask, allowing my hair to drift like kelp blades in the sea. He watched me, silent. Without the noise of the my breathing apparatus, I listened to the clear ocean. A faint wail, the sound from my dreams, vibrated through the deep. I strained my lungs, listening, until I could hold my breather no longer and fumbled the mask back over my head. I cranked up the sensitivity setting on my translationary. Vocalizations, it confirmed, and then printed a screen of garbled text. 

What is that sound? I asked Luken. My translationary chirped happily, relaying the message. 

Hm? Lukun tilted his head, quizzical. I pointed to the scrolling nonsense text on the screen of the translational, as if that would help convey my question.

That melody. I hear it in my dreams.

Oh! He nodded, understanding. That is the ‘Very Long Song.’ Every Ecktu knows it by heart.

Where does it come from?

Lukun waved his handfins up and down. An Ecktuan shrug.

What is it about?

Old things, he replied. Creation. First steps on land. The division of worlds. Wars. Treaties. Mountains sinking. The return to sea. Kelp forests and coral cities.

From the sea we came. To the sea we returned, I recited.

Lukun laughed, amused. I’m surprised they still say that in the cities. Are you staying long?

Two days, I said. I hear there’s a small outbreak of greenworm. 

Yes. My father. He is infected. One of the infected.

I hear it’s easily treatable. 

It is, he clicked. Tomorrow. We are hunting. Do you want to join us?

An open sea hunt! I would love to. 

Nearby. There are specklegill. A small school. Feeding in the crosscurrents. 

I had eaten specklegill a few times before, on special outings or banquets at Kiku. It was gamier in taste than the domestic breeds. The hunt commenced early the next morning. The nomads were equipped with dual-headed spears, a long, smooth tooth on end and a wicked-looking serrated tooth at the other. The barbed spearhead was for the prey, and the straight edge to defend the hunters from other predators that might be attracted to the kill. 

Myself, Niko, and a few other curious reef Ecktu treaded near the surface, watching the distant specklegill school as they swam to and fro, filtering the plankton-rich water through their brown-splotched gills. Like most open ocean fish, their bodies were tall and slender along the vertical axis with a broad, sail-like fin along the spine. From nose to tail their bodies stretched over two meters each.The Ecktu nomads formed a loose perimeter around and below the feeding fish, careful to not disturb them. Then, on signal, a great ruckus of clicks erupted from the hunters. My Pocket Translationary attempted to interpret multitude of clicksee shouts.

Fish on a stick--don’t cross flukes with--seven hundred lengths--thinking on my--how this effects--in love--perhaps! it offered. 

The shouting Ectku approached the school in unison, like a closing net. The specklegill swam frantically in different directions, but never too close to the Ectku and their invisible barrier of sound. The mass of fish condensed as the Ecktu closed in on all sides, driving them to the surface. Several leap vainly out of the water, trying to escape the barrage of clicks. 

An Ecktu broke the perimeter, spear in handfin, and drove the serrated edge into the gills of a nearby specklegill. The fish’s gill slits tore, spitting out bits of flesh as the spear was yanked out. It floundered, writhing in a growing cloud of blood. The hunter left it alone, stabbing the next fish. Two more hunters moved into the interior of the chanting circle and began spearing the  in the same fashion, tearing out the gill slits and letting the fish scramble about until they eventually bled to death or died of asphyxiation. Other members of the nomadic pod approached the scene and gathered the dead fish from the surface, lashing cords around the tails and pulling them out of the way of the hunters. 

After the school had been reduced to about a third of its original size, the hunters ceased their shouting. Like a broken spell, the specklegills’ frenzy ceased. The survivors skittishly swam past the Ecktu and away into clear water. The hunters fastened cords around the tails of the last of the speared fished themselves, and dragged them off to the group of Ecktu nomads that had already started draining excess blood from the bodies, and inspecting for signs of parasites. This was finished with haste.

Lukun swam to me, a specklegill in tow. 

How was the catch? I asked.

Good, he said. Twenty-seven was the tailcount. I think. We’ll keep half. The rest will go to the Academy.

We must move out, said Lukun. A few will stay behind. To chance at big game. Large predators drawn to the blood-smell.


[there is a feast with the fresh fish. Narrator complains about how she has only had soft food since she got here. What she would do for something crunchy]

[blahblahblah need to fix transition to end with additional end.]


The Very Long Song is very long, as it turns out. Niko explained this to me as we rode back to the reef. It goes on months and months, then repeats. Night fell upon the ocean again, draining all notion of space and placement. A few schools of small fish found the krill lanterns, following the glow in hypnotic trance. Holding my breath, I listening to the beating of fins, a muted pattering from above. It was raining. I steered Yawn around the green aura of the convoy. On the other side of his pectoral fin, Niko slumbered on the shark’s back, humming in her sleep.
