## Chapter Three: Umbron, World of Shadows



There’s a name given to people like me: worldskippers. The high-traffic shiftports of the Inner Sphere worlds are filled with worldskippers of various origins, meandering about, skimming over posts on the offworld job boards, contemplating their next destination. Umbron is a well-known destination amongst the skippers, even those that haven’t visited are aware of its polarized reputation. There’s a severe dichotomy of opinions about Umbron. It’s a hit or miss with shifters. Some speak highly of the world, praising its pristine streets, low-crime rates, and strong sense of independence. Those that strongly dislike the world, well, I’ve never heard a concrete reason for their displeasure, only a vague disgruntlement and a strong intent to never return. Initially I suspected that the skipper’s discontent stemmed from the haunting appearance of Umbron’s residents.

The Shadows from Umbron do not have a specific title for their people. They are simply ‘human’ the way people on most worlds, even highly divergent ones like the Ecktu, consider themselves ‘normal’ humans. (As you might suspect, this leads to all sorts of terminology debates between philosophers and politicians over ‘posthumanism’ and ‘transhumanism’.) Without much contest, the Shadows adopted their nickname from offworlders. I think they’re officially called ‘Umbronians’ by politically correct factions, but I have never heard anyone, not even a Shadow, use the that title.

The first Shadow I met was a recruiter from the Eugem Corporation from Umbron. Her skin was perfectly black, darker than any natural pigmentation I had ever seen. As if the fabric of reality were cut out, revealing a void in the shape of silhouette. Looking at her was more like looking into empty space rather than looking at a black object. The only trace of color resided in her reflective ruby irises and ivory teeth that popped out of her space-black face when she smiled. Yes, I could understand the shifters’ apprehension.

“The Eugem Corporation sponsors offworld language instruction in all twenty-three Tier One universities on Umbron,” the recruiter explained. It was the first time I had heard English spoken by anything other than my Pocket Translationary. 

“What about translationaries? I thought the technology was pretty wide-spread throughout the Inner and Mid worlds.” 

“Shadows are a self-reliant people,” said the Shadow lady, blinking her red eyes. “We dislike using gadgets such as translationaries.”

“The Shadows oppose technology?” I asked, suddenly self-conscious of the translationary in my pocket.

“Oh, I think you misunderstand. We do not oppose technology. In fact, you will find that we boast one of the most technologically advanced societies of a world our age. We merely dislike using technology if it is unnecessary. You still seem confused. Is there something that you have a question about?”

“I just can’t figure out what good the English language is to you, especially considering the cost of time, visiting a young world and all.”

“The Eugem Corporation is looking to expand its market and is evaluating possibilities along the Fringe. If you are worried about your salary, I think you will find our compensation quite competitive.”

The recruiter pushed a thick textbook towards me along with a few company brochures.

“Consider this a gift of the Eugem Corporation. Please take some time to consider our offer.”



I do not have a sufficient biological background to explain the unique physiology of the Shadows. To avoid a disservice to their evolutionary history and complex life cycle, I am enclosing an excerpt about the Shadows from Meyar’s Introduction to Xenology:



The characteristic blackness of the Shadows is the result of an epidemic that ravished the world nearly 50,000 years ago. Historians estimate the outbreak of the disease to have occurred between 4 BBE and 20 BE according to the Shadow calendar. The agent of the so-called ‘Black Plague’ was not a strain of virus or bacteria, but the fungus-like multicellular protist, Kayencarro umbronis, common name: kayen. The predatory kayen wove itself into the epidermal cells of its host, leeching nutrients from the blood and bones through hollow microscopic fibers. Airborne spores allowed the kayen to spread rapidly from host to host, coating the entire epidermis with its black tissue, killing the afflicted in as little as six days. After half a century of pandemic, the majority of the inhabitants of Umbron had been wiped out by the plague. A tiny percentage of the infected--less than a fraction of a percent--managed to survive. Scholars estimate this population to number around 600 individuals centralized in the northern continent of Edum. It is unknown whether this survival was initially an adaption of the humans or the kayen or both. Regardless, a small population survived, thrived even, with the kayen coating their skin, acting more as a parasite than a predator.

The tissue of Kayencarro umbronis forms a naturally occurring black body, absorbing over 99.9% of visible-spectra light that hits its surface. (For a more thorough explanation of the kayen’s photon-trapping crystalline matrix, please refer to ‘Appendix F: Shadow Biology’ on page 766 of this text.) Without sufficient light reflecting off the kayen’s surface, the organism appears almost two-dimensional. Kayen also possesses metamorphic properties, having no fixed shape of its own, an individual kayen can mold and change the hardness of its tissue at will. It is believed that this allowed the parasite to maximize the surface area it covered on its host. If it detected danger, such as an attempt from the host to scrap off the protist, the kayen could rigidify its tissue, immobilizing the host. The exact mechanism of this inuring is still being studied by Shadow and offworld scientists (a brief survey of theories is available in Appendix F).

Millenniums passed, and the initially parasitic relationship developed into full mutalism. Human and kayen became Shadow. Bits of DNA were exchanged. Chemical signals developed between the two species.The kayen benefited from a mobile and intelligent host. The sapiens gained a malleable exoskeleton and a steady supply of ATP, which the kayen synthesizes from light energy and carbon ingested by the host. It weaned the Shadows off caloric foods and directed their tastes towards entrees rich in carbon and calcium. Having found a stable niche, the kayen forsook its original contagious nature and became entirely dependent on and exclusive to the Umbron people. 



“I hope--you find the accommodations--very much to your liking,” said Ruban, a representative of Eugem. At this moment he gave up his labored English and resigned to speak into my Pocket Translationary. <<I apologize for my use of a translationary. There are only a handful of Earthens on this world, and you’re one of two that speaks English.>>

<<That’s quite alright,>> I replied. I looked at the Pocket Tranlationary in my hands. The orange paint had been rubbed off every surface except the crevices. <<I’m so used to this thing that I’ve almost forgotten how to speak without it.>>

<<I hope to be conversing with you in your native tongue after a few months.>> He switched back to English, “I am enrolled in your class, you see. Where would you like this?”

<<Over there is fine.>> I pointed at the corner of my new bedroom. Ruban dropped by travel bag down next to the bed. 

<<We added variable polarization to your windows. We understand that most offworlders value concealment in the places that they sleep. Just turn this dial and you can adjust the opacity.>>

The windows were huge. Two of the walls had large bay windows, reaching from the floor to ceiling. The ceiling itself was transparent, save for the triangular trusses that crisscrossed between the panes. Outside lay the cityscape of Brayonen, a grid of glass skyscrapers, jutting from the streets like crystal spars. Sunlight reflected off the thousands of panes, casting angled patterns on the two solid walls of my bedroom. Overhead, clouds moved lazy across the blue sky. 

<<Eugem spared no expense for this top-corner apartment,>> said Ruban. He was clearly proud of this. <<You’ve seen the living room, shall we take a look at the>>--he tried out the word--“Kitchen? As your people say?”

I nodded. An awkward second or two passed before I realized that Ruban was still waiting for my reply. <<Yes,>> I said, <<let’s see the kitchen.>>

Ruban opened a door to what I had thought contained a bedroom closet. It may as well have been a closet. A single-burner stove stood next to a tall gray box with a touchscreen keypad, which I surmised to be a refrigerator. A sink, clearly what equated to a bathroom sink on Umbron, jutted from the wall in front of a mirror. I opened the cabinets. Inside rested pots-and-pan-looking things. 

<<Eugem paid for a private construction company put this in. I hope you will find it satisfactory for your cooking needs.>><<

<<Oh, it’s just lovely,>> I replied. Back on Aris-Daegon I had the option of upgrading my Pocket Translationary OS to version 22.3 with added support for sarcasm. Thank goodness I had passed that up. I touched the keypad on the refrigerator with my fingers. The door unsealed with a hiss and swung open. Empty shelves, lit by a pale light.

<<Where can I buy food?>> I asked.

<<Oh, yes! I apologize! I should have mentioned that earlier. We have connections with several exploid suppliers that should satisfy your sustenance requirements.>>

<<Exploid?>> I looked at the text output of my translationary for the spelling. 

<<I apologize if this offends you. They are the best suppliers the caloric food your species’ metabolism requires. Eugem does not make a habit of involving exploids with our distinguished guests under normal circumstances, rest assured. If this still does not suit you, we can find other arrangements.>>

<<No, no, I’m just curious. Who are these ‘exploids’?>>

<<How much do you know about Shadow reproduction?>> Ruban asked. 

<<Not much, really. What does that have to do with these exploids? Are they deformed?>>

<<To give a short answer, the exploids are mostly religious fanatics. The long answer is a discussion, I think, for another day.>>

<<Sure.>> I shrugged for my own sake, knowing in full that Ruban would miss the gesture. His own expression was impossible to read, lost his void of his silhouette, though I thought I caught a hint of discomfort in his glowing eyes. 



That night I cracked open the xenology textbook Eugem had provided me. My bedroom had artificial lighting installed, wide panels of fluorescent tubes, entirely unnecessary with the blazing city lights pouring through the glass walls. All but a few bright stars were choked out by the metropolitan glow. It was more than enough light to read by. Eugem had conveniently marked the pages pertaining to the Shadow life cycle:



The inhabitants of Umbron possess one of the most complex reproductive cycles among the known worlds. This is undoubtedly due to the merging of the distinct life cycles of the two species that compose the Shadows, Homo sapien umbien and Kayencarro umbronis. Every Shadow is born with a haploid kayen. In a process called kayen-fixation, two haploid Shadows exchange kayen spores through sexual contact, fusing their own kayen’s genetic material with that of the other individual’s spores. It takes around nine to seventeen days for two kayen to fully merge into a new, diploid organism. Until the recent centuries, this spore interchange usually occurred during the first sexual contact of a male and female Shadow. Since the invention of in vitro kayen-fixation by the biologist Kumun Menra in 5650 B.E., the maturation into diploidy has become a largely external process. It should be noted that an individual’s kayen can only transition from haploidy to diploidy once, and that the transition can take place starting around age five of the Shadow, as the kayen reaches sexual maturity sooner than its sapien counterpart.

The one-time exchange of haploid spores between two Shadows provides an extreme case of biologically-enforced reproductive exclusivity. Each haploid kayen stores an imprint of its original host’s DNA as an identifier. Therefore, a diploid Shadow carries the imprint of two sapiens: the original host, and the host from which the spores were received. Fertilization cannot take place if the sperm provided by the male does not match one of the DNA imprints of the female’s diploid kayen. In other words, unfamiliar genetic material is neutralized by the female’s kayen. All reproductive attempts by diploid Shadows other than those original two kayen-mates are effectively sterilized in this manner. While a Shadow female is pregnant, a haploid spore is generated from the mother’s diploid kayen and then attached to the growing fetus. This child will be born with a haploid kayen containing chromosomes from both its mother and her kayen-mate, thus continuing the reproductive cycle. 

Though some consider the Shadows a posthuman species, they still retain the ability to reproduce with most strains of humanity across the worlds, albeit with some complications. Kayen fixation can occur between a haploid Shadow and a non-Shadow human. Instead of a mutual exchange of spores, the Shadow simply gives spores to the non-Shadow, receiving nothing in return. The Shadow’s kayen then enters a confused state commonly known as ‘exploidy’ where the haploid kayen believes itself to be diploid, despite lacking a second set of chromosomes. Exploid Shadows exhibit an interesting side-effect: the ability to alter the structure of the kayen’s crystalline matrix to reflect specific wavelengths of light. This allows the exploid Shadow to manipulate the color its skin. It is believed that this genetic trait lies in a vestige allele inherited from the ancestors of the original predatory kayen protist. Exploids stop synthesizing the repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of this ancestral trait. Exploids also lose some of their autotrophic capacity, requiring the ingestion of external sources of energy to supplement the reduced amount of self-synthesized ATP. Exploids may attempt to pass as non-Shadow humans, mimicking their skin coloration. Posing as a diploid Shadow is relatively difficult for exploids as the Shadow sensory system can easily detect the ploidy of an individual’s kayen. 

The non-human partner in the fixation process gains a reduced amount of kayen. Kayen-fixation onto a non-Shadow results in a particularly painful process as the protist threads its network of microfibrils through layers of tissue, working its way into the bone marrow of the individual. A non-Shadow that acquires kayen is not considered an exploid but a ‘half-Shadow,’ as the kayen of the receiver does not posses the same color-changing properties of exploid kayen. Exploids lose the ability to reproduce with their fellow Shadows, though children may be conceived between an exploid and non-Shadow coupling. If the female carrying the child is an exploid, the offspring has a 50% chance of being born as a fully haploid Shadow, and a 50% chance of being born as non-Shadow human. If the exploid parent is the father, the child will be born without kayen as a non-Shadow. The same percentage exists for half-Shadow and non-Shadow reproduction.



I had the rare opportunity to meet an exploid, only two days after I had arrived on Umbron. 

<<Please come in. It’s nice to see another human face!>> I said to the repairman standing in my doorway. <<A non-Shadow human, I mean.>>

He seemed embarrassed by this statement, and replied with a simple <<Hello>> as he stepped into my apartment. He wore a foreign-looking set of work clothes and carried nothing else with him. No tool box. I lead him to my closet-kitchen and motioned toward the stove.

<<I think it might be improperly wired. It hasn’t worked since I got here.>>

The repairman lifted the stove plate up and poked at its guts. He mumbled to himself quietly as he worked. I tried to fill the space. 

<<So…What world do you come from?>>

<<This one.>>

<<Were your parents immigrants?>>

<<No, I think you are mistaken. I am a Shadow.>> His skin rippled and like a passing eclipse, turned from its tan coloration to that unmistakable void-black. 

<<You’re an exploid!>> I gasped. I cringed as the translationary relayed my words, hoping my surprised reaction would be toned down in translation.

<<Yes,>> he said. <<And proud.>>

<<Proud? Do Shadows consider exploidy shameful?>>

<<Most do. But it is because my people lost their true sense of shame long ago when they embraced darkness.>>

<<You mean the kayen?>>

<<Yes.>> He lifted his black arm and displayed it to me. <<Most Shadows believe this to be an evolutionary leap. There is an old legend, that when the Black Plague, a demonic pestilence, some say, had nearly wiped out my people, a scalebat approached to the last two humans, husband and wife, each writhing in the black throes of the protist. The scalebat offered to deliver the pair from the plague if they only swear allegiance to the darkness. The couple, weak in their fear of extinction, promised the lives and the lives of their children to the dark. The scalebat, upholding his end of the bargain, saved them, not from the grips of the plague as they had expected, but by making the plague a part of them. And so my people aligned themselves with the devil.>>

<<Do you believe this legend?>>

<<Not literally. But it speaks truth, nonetheless. Look at the Shadows. They sold their humanity for survival. They walk around naked like animals. They eat the sun’s rays like plants.>>

<<I hear it’s not uncommon for posthuman species lose their need for clothing. Like the Ecktu. Wearing clothes underwater seems mighty impractical.>>

<<I am not well-versed in xenology but perhaps these Ecktu have forsaken their humanity as well. Clothing is symbolic of our sinfulness that we must cover. The Shadows cloak themselves in sin. They revel in it.>>

I wanted to question the extremeness of his views, but couldn’t think of a way without potentially offending his beliefs. So I changed the subject.

<<So you chose to become an exploid?>>

<<There’s a stereotype that exploids come out of these closed-door religious communities. I grew up in a kayen-embracing Shadow household like most kids. But something was off. I could feel it. There’s some terribly twisted in Shadow culture. It’s hard to explain other than what I said earlier: they are shameless. When I turned seventeen, the age when one can artificially fix their kayen and become a full-fledged diploid, I refused to undergo the procedure. My parents were fairly well off, and they had found me several good matches for the exchange. One of the females was a junior mountaineering champion. My parents begged me to reconsider, and when that didn’t work, they tried to blackmail me into diploidy, threatening to cut my university funding. They had paid a fair sum to a matchmaking service to find a good genetic fit.>>

<<Why was this so important?>> I asked.

<<You are familiar with the reproductive constraints of Shadows, correct? Shadows can only bear children with the person to which they bind their kayen. It’s a weighty decision because if you ever want to have kids, it has to be with this single person. Now most Shadows don’t rear children with their kayen-mate. There are contractual agreements established during the matchmaking process regarding how many children the pair will produce and how they will be divided up among the parents. Anyhow, because it’s widely accepted that the other parent of your children will be a different person than your life-mate, this opens up the possibility for the genetic optimization of progeny. I was fairly nonathletic as a kid, so my parents wanted to balance out the stamina of their grandchildren. They probably thought that I myself could benefit from a stronger vein of kayen as well.>>

<<I didn’t know the process of fixation was this complex.>>

<<It’s funny you say that, working for Eugem.>>

<<I’m sponsored by them,>> I corrected. For some reason I felt this distinction was important. 

<<Well, the company that pays your rent provides one of the largest matchmaking networks on Umbron. There’s a lot of money in it.>> The repairman pulled out two capped cords from the stove’s interior. <<Ah. You were right about the wiring. These stupid diploids have no idea how to install a stove.>>

<<Hey, what about the rest of the story? How did you end up as an exploid?>>

<<There’s a line of offworlders wishing to become half-Shadows. I made an arrangement with an offworlder to fix my kayen to her. Made a good deal of money from it as well, which came in handy when my parents kicked me out. Living as an exploid is not easy. Hardy food is pretty expensive on this world.>>

<<Why would anyone want to become a half-Shadow? Isn’t a painful process?>>

<<Oh, I hear it’s a week of pure hell. But many think the advantages of kayen to outweigh the agony of fixation. Kayen-supplemented strength. Decreased dependency on food. Increased lifespan. And then there’s the metamorphic stuff.>> The repairman raised his black hands. His right thumb elongated, forming a knife-shaped protrusion. He then proceeded to use his knife-thumb to cut away the safety-casing around the fuel wires. After he had linked the two tubes together, using another kayen protrusion to tighten the screws, he opened his hand. Black blades swelled out of his remaining fingers, nightmarish claws. He extended his razor fingers towards me for examination. I slid my fingertips lightly over the edge of the kayen. It had the feel of metal, except warm, with a slight pulse. A drop of blood fell from my index finger onto the tiled floor. 

<<A government would pay a fortune for an army of half-Shadows, don’t you think?>> The repairman retracted the blades back into his hand. His teeth gleamed, a disembodied grin in faceless black. He returned the plating to the top of the stove and twisted a dial on the front panel. Blue flames burst from the burner. 

<<Thank you,>> I said. He switched off the stove. The repairman wandered out of the kitchen to the southern window of my bedroom, overlooking the diamond skyline. 

<<Shadows in glass houses,>> he muttered. <<I didn’t choose this for myself, but for my children. Someday I’ll move offworld, marry an earth-skinned human, and God-willing have kids that know to hide their own nakedness.>> He closed his ruddy eyes and breathed deeply in the glaring sun rays. Then he sheathed his blackness in fleshly color, leaving the way he came. 



“I can understand the sentiments of the exploid you met, but I think he’s--what’s the word--misappropriating causality.” Across the booth sat Breyon, an exceptional student from one of my advanced conversation courses. She was studying anthroxenology at the university, with a concentration in Fringe worlds. Each student in the advanced course was required to meet for conversation practice, though Breyon and I ended up conversing more frequently than my syllabus mandated. We had established the habit of grabbing drinks at the university pub after the night class. Alcohol is the one food the Shadow people held onto, despite the fact that they don’t need the calories. Then again, who does? Breyon swallowed the last gulp from her bottle before she continued, “I’m sure you’ve seen this on your own world. Technology advances. Technology is abused. Or at the very least, technology is used in seemingly unnatural ways. Then a group of zealots rise up, blaming the technology for the degradation of their society.” 

“That’s an interesting analogy. But technology isn’t part of our being, the way you Shadows see yourself inseparable from your kayen.”

“I would debate that. Technology is central in the evolution of all humanity. Tools allow a species to quickly adapt to pressing survival issues. But in order to use tools, a species must evolve the brain capacity to think creativity about its environment, a language to teach tool-use to its children, and a society that fosters invention. We had this dependency just like you, well before the Plague altered our biology. The kayen frees us from having to carry around ridiculous assortments of gadgets for simple tasks.” She created a hook with her black fingers and pried the cap off another bottle of husk beer. 

“Doesn’t it feel strange though, being the composite of two species?”

“Evolution is messy. And not always linear. It’s estimated that seven to fifteen percent of human DNA--humans and posthumans alike--is actually viral DNA retroactively inserted over the course of history. You have organelles in your own cells that were originally a separate species. I expect that ten thousand years from now, enough DNA transfer will occur to make the Shadows essentially one species. Your exploid friend probably thinks the fusing of species is unnatural, but I doubt he ever took a introductory-level biology course.” 

“I thought you said you sympathized with him.”

“Well, yes and no. His understanding of evolutionary history is a bit naive. But I’ve heard similar critiques of society, and I can’t say I disagree with all of them. The problem isn’t the protist, though, it’s that people are human. We’ll always find some way to twist something or another.” She turned her gaze to the glass wall separating our booth from the pulsing neon streets. I could make out the profile of her face, the soft angles of her nose and cheeks.

“The elaborate kayen-matching process is only necessary because Shadows can’t comprehend the idea of reproduction and sex going hand-in-hand. Artificial kayen fixation protects their rights to progeny and also their rights to sexual freedom in one clever system. They can select their kayan-mate to produce children of optimal health and at the same time find their ideal life-mate to insure the healthiest relationship between parents. That’s the reasoning at least.” 

“It seems reasonable enough. Yet you disagree?”

“There are some Shadows that hold to older ways, even more old-fashioned than the exploid-movement. You’re not a Shadow, so this is not readily apparent to you, but I’m twenty-five years old and still a haploid. And it’s not because I intend to become a clergyman or pursue monastic orders. I can live without optimization.”



Weeks later, on my way home from another late-night pub conversation with Breyon, a young Shadow boy approached me on the brightly-lit streets. 

<<Hey offworlder, are you looking for me?>> he asked.

<<Shouldn’t you be at home with your parents?>> Umbron is not known for its street crime, so I didn’t fear for the boy’s safety as much as the concern of his parents.

<<My mom said she couldn’t afford to keep me.>>

<<Do you have a place to stay?>> I asked. <<Is someone taking care of you?>> 

<<Yes, I live with other kids. Healthy haploids like me. Adults take care of us. Do you want to visit?>>

<<It’s a little late for a visit. But I would like to walk you home. Can you show me the way?>>

The little Shadow grabbed may hand and led me through a maze of grungy-glassed alleyways. He stopped at stairwell that led to a basement door at the very bottom of a skyscraper.

<<If you choose me, will you take me offworld with you?>>

<<Let’s get you home,>> I said. I descended the staircase and knocked on the the door. 

<<May I help you?>> answered voice from the inside. 

<<I found one of your kids wandering the street. Can you let us inside?>>

<<Yes, yes, of course.>> The door swung open and a tall male Shadow ushered me into the underground corridor. He lead me and the Shadow boy past several bedrooms lined with bunk beds. <<Most of our children are sleeping right now, but if you see one you like, we can awaken him for inspection.>>

<<No, no, I’m not looking for any kids,>> I said.

<<Are you sure? Perhaps I could interest you in young Run here. He just reached haploid maturity last month. A late bloomer, but studies show that haploid maturity, not age matters most in reducing the length of fixation-->>

<<Dakum!>> barked another Shadow. His dark form burst out of a room and paced towards the three of us. <<What is she doing here?>>

<<I was merely showing our esteemed offworld customer our selection of haploids.>>

<<She is not a customer.>> The angry Shadow grabbed me by the arm and yanked me toward the entrance. The little Shadow boy waved goodbye as I was escorted out, his red eyes burning like sad stars in the dark hallway.

“I am so sorry about this,” said in a familiar voice. “There has been some confusion.”

“Ruben? What the hell is this place?” I tried to wrestle away from his grip, but one does not easily out-muscle a Shadow. He released me once we had exited the building. 

“There is a very good explanation which I will be very happy to explain to you once you return to your apartment.” 

“No. No. No. I don’t think that will be necessary. I’ve seen enough.”



That was the last night I spent on Umbron. The next morning I walked straight to the Interworld Embassy and shifted away to the next passing world.
