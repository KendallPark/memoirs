## Chapter Five: The Nomads of Rim



Rim was the last world I visited in my travels. It was another Fringe world, with a particularly unique climatic setting. The planet of Rim rotates very, very slowly. So slowly that its day is technically longer than its year, that is--it complete an orbit around its sun sooner than it rotates around its own axis. There is a planet in our system like this, Venus. But unlike Venus, Rim is habitable, albeit, only in the sliver of twilight that separates the sunny side of the planet from the dark side. The sunny side of the world burns while the dark side freezes. The people of Rim live in the twilight area of the their planet, traveling with the habitable zone as the planet slowly revolves.

Shifting onto Rim was particularly tricky, as one had to coordinate the shifting into the planet’s twilight meridian. This gets even more complicated, has one has to run calculations to account for the different of time between the departure planet and the arrival planet. Frontiers Exploration boasted an 87% success rate of landing a client within the habitable zone of Rim. Granted, a 13% chance of being either burned alive or frozen to death (because that was something I wanted to try again) seems like a lot. I suppose after my time on Tenal Picii, I was feeling a bit reckless. 

Thankfully, the shift was successful, and I was picked up by the Lower Equatorial Caravan, a small, mobile village. It was there that I met a former worldskipper, Marina. She was an older lady, around sixty or so years old, though with shifters, years of age don’t carry over cleaning from world to world. Despite her age, Marina  was in excellent health. She had grown up on Rim, but after seventeen circulations of the same planet, along the same roads, with the same people constantly around her, she shifted away. 



<These things have gotten so much more advanced than in my day,> she said, holding my Pocket Translationary. <The older models had no auditory output--you had to read the translation off the screen. And you had to replace the batteries every few months. None of this solar-power business.>

We were walking, as we always walked, to the west, chasing the sunset. When the air grew too warm we would stop, rest, fix the wheels on the carts, hunted and gathered food from the plants that sprouted quickly to mate in the temperate climate. It was remarkable that fauna on this planet managed to survive. The plants sprouted, mated, and bore fruit at an accelerated rate as the region of twilight passed over them, then lay dormant as either the sun ignited the face of the planet with its presence or froze it in its absence.

<Did you ever visit Earth?> I asked. 

<No, but I’ve heard a little about it. Fringe worlds aren’t popular destinations, due to the natural time constraints.>

<I know. There’s been a recent revival in interest along the Fringe, but I don’t think it will last.>

<Hey, but it works great for people like you and me. We can visit any other world in the multiverse and never have to worry about returning home a hundred years later. Heck, you could spend a year on a Central world during a bathroom break on your own.>

We laughed at this.

<Have you even been to Ecktuo, then?>

<No. It was more dangerous back then. I knew too many shifters that came back from Ecktuo with severe cases of the bends. The Camirians took their sweet time calibrating the gas mixtures in their tanks. Some of the places I’ve been… hmmm… it’s been a while. I spent most of my time on Keteknia, but that’s because I married a Ketek and settled down there. Before that I visited Florisca, Endos, Citreul, Wrelsh, Umbron…> 

I made a face at the last name. 

<Oh. I know,> she sympathized. <Messed up place. What about Aeron? The sky planet? Have you been there?>

<No, not yet.>

<I would highly recommended. While you’re still young, too. The planet’s atmosphere is fairly dense, so you’ll need to acquire a respirator of sorts, but it allows for very easy flight. Cities are built atop these floating bodies of gas, insula caelum, I think they’re called. There’s an entire ecosystem that exists entirely independent from the ground.>

<That sounds incredible!>

<It is. Please consider it.>

<Definitely.>



[More conversation occurs. The narrator finds out why Marina returned home.]



<Keteknia was a nice world. I loved my husband, raised two kids there. My husband and I had traveled the worlds together, and we decided it was best to raise our kids in a stable location. I was pretty content with my life there. Then I guess middle age hit, and I grew restless again. I would find myself wandering towards the sunset during the evenings. Sometimes I would wake up in the morning on the western edge of my house. My husband died around ten years ago--he was a bit older than me so it wasn’t an early death by Ketek standards. My kids had grown up, with families of their own. So I bid them farewell and returned to Rim.>

<Don’t you miss them?> I asked.

<Of course. But they have their own lives, and I’m not suited for sedentary life. I’ll keep walking, keep walking until I die. At least here I can walk with my family here.>





[The narrator has significant issues crossing over a small mountain range (which has to be done quickly because time is wasted on the ascent and descent). On the descent, she catches her foot in a crevice and tears several ligaments in her knees (ACL, LCL). She can walk, but it is difficult for her, and her knee with often give out. There is a shiftport nearby, but the habitable region is too far along its course to reach the shiftport before the winter hits hard. The leader of the Lower Equatorial Caravan decides that the best chance that the narrator has in getting offworld for surgery is to survive the winterover. There are shelters built along the path for this purpose. Marina volunteers to stay in the winterover with the narrator and help her find the shift port. There are plants essential to the extreme ecosystem of Rim that produce coma-inducing serums. Many of the animals on Rim use these to hibernate during the winterover. The narrator and Marina survive the winterover and Marina helps the narrator find the shiftport, a small cave cut into the side of the mountain ridge.]



Marina helped me sit down on the floor of the shiftport.

<This is where I first left my world.> she said. She breathed deeply. She was sensing the links between the worlds, examining them. <It seems you have a number of choices.> 

<Yeah. And it feels like a few central worlds are in the mix.>

<I would try one of those. As you know, their technology is generally on the advanced side, and I suspect you’ll be able to get treatment for your knee there. Good luck.> She gave me a hug.

<Wait, you’re not coming with me?> I had thought she would shift offworld with me, then wait for an opportunity to return to her village the next time they passed this spot. 

<No, I’m too old to be jumping from planet to planet anymore. This is home, there is only one.> With that she turned and left. I watched her, walking eastward towards the glowing sky, unable to run after her in my condition. The air was warming, and the sun had already risen on the other side of the mountain range. It was climbing, slowly. I called after Marina. She kept walking.

The sunlight started bleeding through the gaps in the mountain range, a molten flame pouring into the shadows. The light, brilliant and blinding, flowed into the crevices and spread over the plains below. Marina was engulfed, transfigured into a pillar of white ash, then wisped away by the wind.

The air scorched my skin and lungs, even in the shadow of the shiftport cavern. The temperature kept climbing. I tugged on the extradimensional strings of the worlds. There was only one that I recognized. 

I held my breath and shifted.
