## Abstract
A young woman tries to escape the pain of the human condition by fleeing to alien worlds. It doesn't work.

## About
This is a science fiction novel in progress. It is incomplete and unedited. Like a rough draft except rougher.

I find that the rate limiting step in my writing is my actual writing. My prose is pretty mediocre.

## Why Open Source?
Well, it's technically not open source by the true definition of open source. But all of the working rough drafts, revisions and so forth are available for public viewing. You can even make copies for yourself for non-commercial purposes as long as I am credited. 

I'm strongly considering dropping this down to a less strict license in the future. That's my inner Linux user speaking. 

## Contributing
See a typo or grammatical error? Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/pulls)!

I will take questions and suggestions for particular passages as [issue submissions](https://github.com/KendallPark/memoirs/issues). 

## Acknowledgments
Since I was a child my mind has constructed alien worlds in its spare time. I owe a heavy debt to Changing Planes by Ursula K. LeGuin for revealing to me the format by which I write about my imaginary planets. 

I would also like to thank my friend Winston Smith, another being tragically trapped on this planet, for his world-building input.

Special thanks to Prof. Mazzerella, who allowed this science major into her advanced creative writing courses.
